# Seismic-Data-Analysis
  Microseismic Event Detector

A simple browser-based demo that simulates microseismic signals and detects “events” in real time using only **React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.

## Purpose
Showcases a lightweight approach to real-time seismic signal monitoring.

## Features
- Synthetic seismic-like waveform with random noise and spikes
- Adjustable detection threshold slider
- Real-time visualization on an HTML `<canvas>`
- Event counter with live updates

## Quick Start
```bash
npx create-react-app microseismic-detector
cd microseismic-detector
npm start
